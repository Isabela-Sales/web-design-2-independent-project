      <h2>Types of Wines</h2>
      <p>Wines are divided in three broad categories, being white, rosé and red.</p>

      <div tabindex="0" id="broad-categories">
        <ul class="card">
          <li>
            <img class="icon" src="images/white-wine.jpg" alt="White wine texture">
            <h3>White</h3>
            <p>A mild wine that goes well with delicate dishes such as salads, fishes, and seafood. Curiously, the white wine can be produced from white or red grapes. It just requires to be fermented separately from grapes skin, once this is what convey the colour and taste to red wines.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <img class="icon" src="images/rose-wine.jpg" alt="Rosé wine texture">
            <h3>Rosé</h3>
            <p>In the past, rosés were produced by mixing red and white wines in equal proportions. This method is not much used today. Instead, the wine is exposed to red grapes skin for a while during the fermentation, just enough to let it absorb some tannins — but less than a red wine.</p>

          </li>

          <li>
            <img class="icon" src="images/red-wine.jpg" alt="Red wine texture">
            <h3>Red</h3>
            <p>The most strong type among wines, the red one can achieve many distinctive levels of flavours. Into this category, you can find since smooth until full bodies wines. They are produced only by red grapes and are exposed to the grape skin during the whole fermentation process.</p>

          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>Narrowing down these classifications, we have some more types that appear with their particularities, such as harmonization, notes, ideal temperature, and appropriated glass.</p>

      <h2>Curiosities</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Champagne and sparkling wine are not synonymous. Any Champagne is, in fact, a sparkling wine, but it receives this denomination only when is produced in Champagne — a French territory. It needs to follows a specific production method and uses local grapes to be considered one.
        </li>
        <li>Not any red wine can be harmonized with cheese. The pigment of the red wine comes from the tannins, a substance present in the red grape skin. Usually, tannins are not a good match for fat, which is abundant on the majority of hard cheeses.
        </li>
        <li>The green wine is actually classified as white wine and not a separated category, like some people believe. Its differentiation is in the fact that it’s made out of grapes which didn’t reach the complete maturation yet.
        </li>
      </ul>
