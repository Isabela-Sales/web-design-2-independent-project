              <h3>Preparation</h3>
              <p>Cook the sweet potatoes: If you have time, bake the sweet potatoes in the oven. Poke some holes in them with a fork and bake them at 375°F for 45 to 60 minutes until they are very tender and give easily to a fork poke. Also, the skin should get dry and crackly. Option two, if you are in a hurry, is to microwave the sweet potatoes. Poke holes in them with a fork and microwave them for two 5-minute intervals on high. They will be very hot after they come out, and the skin won’t be quite as good as the baked version, but it works well for this recipe.</p>
              <p>In a medium skillet over medium heat, add olive oil, followed by onions, bell pepper, black beans, and sweet corn. Season with salt and pepper and cook for 4 to 5 minutes until the vegetables soften, but aren’t browned at all. Remove from heat.</p>
              <p>When sweet potatoes are cool enough to handle, split them open with a knife and use a fork to mash up the sweet potato flesh. I recommend opening up the sweet potatoes by slicing horizontal slits near each end of the sweet potato, which will make it easier to spread open.
                Once the sweet potato flesh is mashed, add some queso fresco to each potato and divide the sautéed filling among the potatoes. Stuff them full! Top with any extra cheese you might have.</p>
                <p>Bake the sweet potatoes for 20 minutes at 350°F. Serve: Serve sweet potatoes with optional ingredients or just a sprinkle of chopped fresh cilantro. Leftover stuffed sweet potatoes will store well in the fridge for 4 to 5 days and reheat best in the oven.</p>

              <h3>Preparation</h3>
              <p>Preheat the oven to 375°F.
                Halve the garlic heads and place them on a baking sheet lined with tin foil.
                Drizzle over 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and season generously with salt. Wrap the heads of garlic with another piece of foil and bake for 45-60 minutes, or until the garlic is caramelized and soft.
                Allow the garlic to cool a little bit before handling.
                While the garlic is cooling, heat a large pot over medium heat and add the remaining olive oil and the butter.
                Once the butter is melted, squeeze the roasted garlic from the skins directly into the pot. Add in the sliced shallot and a pinch of salt. Cook for 5 minutes, or until the shallots are softened.
                Add in the fresh sage and rosemary and stir to combine. Cook for another minute.
                Add in the potato and beans and stir everything well to combine. Stream in the broth, another pinch of salt, some black pepper and bring the mixture to a simmer.
                Simmer over medium-low heat for 20 minutes or until the potato is super tender and falling apart.
                Puree the soup until completely smooth – either transfer to a regular blender (in batches) or blend directly in the pot using an immersion blender.
                Return the soup to the pot and stir in the cream. Season, to taste, with additional salt and pepper. Keep warm until ready to serve.</p>
                <p>While the soup is cooking, make the herb oil by combining the oil and herbs in a food processor. Run the machine for a minute, pausing to scrape down teh slides of the bowl as needed. You want the herbs completely pulverized.
                  Use the herb as is or strain through a fine-mesh strainer if a smoother consistency is desired (as shown in the photos of this post).</p>
                  <p>Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with a drizzle of cream (or a dollop of sour cream) and a drizzle of the herb oil.
                    Sprinkle each bowl of soup with fresh chives. Serve immediately with toasty bread on the side.</p>

<div class="preparation">
                    <h3>Preparation</h3>
                    <p>In a large bowl, beat eggs vigorously with a large pinch of salt until frothy. Set aside.
                      Meanwhile, in a 10-inch nonstick or well-seasoned carbon steel skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add potatoes and onions; they should gently (but not vigorously) bubble in the oil. Regulating heat to maintain a gentle bubbling, cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes and onions are meltingly tender, about 25 minutes. Set a fine-mesh strainer over a heatproof bowl and drain potatoes and onions of excess oil. Reserve oil.</p>

                      <p>Transfer potatoes and onions to a medium heatproof bowl and season generously with salt, stirring well to combine. Beat eggs vigorously to re-froth, then scrape potato and onion in and stir until thoroughly combined. Set aside for 5 minutes.  Meanwhile, wipe out skillet. Add 3 tablespoons (45ml) reserved frying oil to skillet and set over medium-high heat until shimmering. Scrape egg mixture into skillet and cook, swirling and shaking pan rapidly, until bottom and sides begin to set, about 3 minutes. Using a heatproof spatula, press the edges in to begin to form the tortilla's puck shape. Continue to cook, adjusting heat to prevent bottom of tortilla from burning, until beginning to set around edges, about 3 minutes longer.</p>

                      <p>Working over a sink or garbage can, place a large overturned flat plate or lid on top of skillet, set hand on top (using a dish towel if you are sensitive to heat), and, in one very quick motion, invert tortilla onto it. Add 1 more tablespoon (15ml) reserved oil to skillet and return to heat. Carefully slide tortilla back into skillet and continue to cook until second side is beginning to firm up, about 2 minutes. Use rubber spatula to again press the sides in all around to form a rounded puck shape. Continue to cook tortilla until lightly browned on second side but still tender in the centre when pressed with a finger, about 2 minutes longer. If desired, you can flip tortilla 2 to 3 more times during these last minutes of cooking, which helps to cook the centre more evenly and reinforce the shape.</p>

                      <p>Carefully slide tortilla out of skillet onto a clean plate (or invert it onto a clean plate using same method as before) and let stand at least 5 minutes before serving with aioli. Tortilla can be cut into wedges for a larger meal or into cubes for an hors d'oeuvre–sized snack. It is just as good, if not better, at room temperature. Leftover tortilla can be refrigerated up to 3 days; allow to return to room temperature before serving. Remaining frying oil can be used in other dishes; it has an excellent flavour thanks to the long cooking with potato and onion.</p>

                        <p>Preparation Step 1 Heat griddle or skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Step 2 Spread butter on one side of each slice of bread. Spread peanut butter on unbuttered side of one slice of bread, and jelly on the other. Place one slice, buttered side down on the griddle. Top with other slice, so that peanut butter and jelly are in the middle. Cook for 4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown, and heated through.</p>
